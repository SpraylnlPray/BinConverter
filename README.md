# BinConverter
A program that converts a string message into its binary representation, with an implementation proposed by Witten, Neal and Cleary in 1987.
We saw the Algorithm in the Digital Media class in University by Prof. Dr. Ulhaas.

## How does it work?
The algorithm will use the number of absolute and accumualted appearances of a char in the string.
After creating a table with these values for each char, it will go through each char and calculate the binary representation and add it to the output.

## How to use it?
Start the program, you will be asked if you want to activate the test mode or not.
### Test mode
The programm will give you the posibility to input a letter, together with its absolute appearance. The idea is, to be able to test the output by calculating the result by hand.
This is a lot easier if you can do that with a short word, than having to do it with a long input.
### Normal mode
The programm will ask you to input a message.

In the end the programm will output the binary representation.
